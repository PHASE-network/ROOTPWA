A few notes on usages:

To produce predict plots from already computed phase-space amplitudes use evtweight like in the following example:

evtweight -e ../1840.1900.genbod.evt -o ~/scratch/COMPASS/rootpwa/trunk/ltfit11predict1.root -w ../../../PWAFITS/LOWT/fit11/1840.2080.result.acc.root -i norm.int -m 1870

You have to call this from the directory where the amplitude-files are located!!

To do a full predict analysis we require the following script:

For each bin do:
	Go to correct PSPAMPS directory
	Determine correct fitResult file (how??? -- use hadd to put all fitResult Trees together!)
	Call evtweight like above
	Call evt2root for data if not already done
	Call plotWeightedEvents with correct files
	Collect corresponding histo files and make a nice overview plot
end for
