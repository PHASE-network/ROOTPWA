# `sandBox` Directory #

This directory is intended to be used for code that is not yet mature or general enough to be useful for all users. The integration of new code can be tested here and made available for other users to test. The compilation of this directory is optional and disabled by default. You may enable the compilation via command-line argument by calling

    `cmake -DCOMPILE_SANDBOX=ON ..`

in your `build` directory.
