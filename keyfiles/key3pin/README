This directory contains the information required to create the keyfiles for
the pi- pi0 pi0 channel. The keyfiles are created with the programme
'generateWaveSet' called from the script 'GenerateKeyfiles.sh'. This script
can be controlled by a number of environment variables.

DESTINATION_DIR
should be set to the directory that should contain the keyfiles. The default
is 'keyfiles' as a subdirectory of the current directory. This directory will
be created if it does not exist. Be careful, files in this directory might be
deleted by the script.

PARTICLE_DATA_TABLE
points to the particle data table that should be used for the generation of
the wavesets. By default the one in ROOTPWA's 'amplitude' directory is used
(specified by the relative path, so this has to be changed, if this script is
moved from its original place in the repostitory).

WAVESET_FILES
is a list of wavesets. By default this list is empty, and then no additional
action is taken. If this list is not empty, then only those keyfiles actually
used in one of those wavesets are kept, and all others are removed, e.g.
            WAVESET_FILES=wavelist.* ./GenerateKeyfiles.sh
will keep all keyfiles for waves used in at least one waveset in the current
directory. Files in this list will also be copied to the destination directory
and copies of each file taking into account the different wave names for the
various mass dependences of the f0(980) will be created.


A couple of wavesets are also provided. These are the references
