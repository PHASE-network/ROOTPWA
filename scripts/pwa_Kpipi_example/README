This folder contains an automized PWA analysis.
This is a demonstration ment to be copied and modified
to your needs.
You may try to use the steps for them self but
it is not prooved to work that way.

1. Set $ROOTPWA to your rootpwa directory. 
	Put it for example in the .bashrc
2. . run_Kpipi_PWA_analysis.sh
	pray it works not only on my machine
	
Enjoy!
