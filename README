### Workflow and data management instructions ###

Organization of Data:
		* There is one subdirectory for each mass bin
		  with naming convention:
			LowerBound.Upperbound (in MeV)
			e.g.: 1000.1080
		* The substructure then is
			1000.1080
				1000.1080.evt (event data in gamp format)
				MC            (monte carlo data)
				AMPS          (Amplitude files for real data)
				PSPAMPS       (Phase Space Amps from MC)
		* With pruning this will become more complicated!
