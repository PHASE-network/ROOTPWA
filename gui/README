This is an example workspace you may use as a starting point for your analysis:

- 3 empty folders are given: ./data ./fits ./keyfiles (my personal suggestion).
- then you have the example.cfg that has to be loaded by the rootpwa_gui, BUT
- before you do this you have to modify this example to your needs (look inside example.cfg).
- Please be aware that all comments in there will be dropped when saving the configuration loaded to rootpwa_gui, so I suggest
- to copy the example.cfg first and to modify the copied version

The rest of the story should explain more or less it self.
