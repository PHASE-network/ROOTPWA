The code in this package `pwa2000` has been developed by John Cummings at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute [1]. It was originally used for partial-wave analyses at the Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), US.

The original sources have been distributed from the website <http://ignatz.phys.rpi.edu/~jpc/john/Physics/PWA/pwa.html>.

We include the original code archives
*   `libpp-src.7jul2005.tgz` (has been extracted to libpp/ for further development)
*   `pwa2000-src.7jul2005.tgz` (has been extracted to gamp/ for further development)
in this repository for future reference.

During the adaption of the code to ROOTPWA several patches have been created which we also provide for future reference.

For installation instructions see the `README.markdown` file in the ROOTPWA projetc root directory.
